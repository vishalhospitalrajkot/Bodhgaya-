    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application uses a thematic, single-page dashboard structure with a sticky navigation bar for easy access to key sections: 'The Enlightenment' (History, religious significance, archaeological context), 'Sacred Sites' (Mahabodhi Temple Complex & other major monuments, including architecture and archaeology), 'Global Village' (International Monasteries), 'Living Traditions' (Festivals/Rituals), 'Current Controversies' (new section for management issues and protests), 'Plan Your Visit' (Travel, Accommodation, Safety, and a 3-Day Itinerary), and 'Contact' (new section for hospital and doctor information). This non-linear structure allows users to jump to topics of interest, encouraging non-sequential discovery. Key interactions include a clickable timeline for history with detailed modals, a visual CSS-grid map of the Mahabodhi complex, descriptive cards for other monuments, a filterable gallery for monasteries, interactive cards for festivals, tabbed content for rituals, and practical visitor information with filters and a suggested itinerary. This design prioritizes user engagement and intuitive data synthesis, offering a comprehensive and accessible exploration of Bodhgaya beyond a linear report, including its modern challenges and important local contacts. -->

                <p class="max-w-3xl mx-auto">At the heart of Bodhgaya lies the Mahabodhi Temple Complex, a UNESCO World Heritage site and a sacred landscape that maps the Buddha's journey to and through enlightenment. The complex is not just a single temple but a collection of sites commemorating the seven weeks the Buddha spent in meditation after his awakening. Its 55m central temple is surrounded by four smaller towers, ancient railings, the sacred Bodhi Tree, the Vajrasana (“Diamond Throne”), and several votive stupas.

                <p class="max-w-3xl mx-auto mb-4">The Mahabodhi Temple, with its red-brick and layered pyramidical spire, exemplifies Gupta-period aesthetics and is among India's earliest brick-built Buddhist shrines, deeply influential on later temple architecture. It houses a 1,700-year-old gilded Buddha statue in *bhumisparsha mudra* (earth-touching pose). Surrounding shrines commemorate Buddha's post-enlightenment weeks. The site suffered decay during the 12th–13th centuries after invasions, leading to restoration efforts by King Kyanzittha of Burma (1100 CE), later Burmese missions, and British archaeologist Alexander Cunningham (1870s).</p>
                <p class="max-w-3xl mx-auto">Extensive archaeological excavations by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), starting in the late 19th century, uncovered earlier shrine foundations, including Ashokan brick floors and early Buddhist artifacts. These discoveries, along with terracotta votive plaques, are now displayed at the Bodhgaya Archaeological Museum (est. 1956). Ongoing archaeological work at sites like Taradih Monastery and Bakraur Stupa (1 km northeast) continue to reveal monastic universities from the 4th–12th century CE. The site's conservation is jointly managed by the Archaeological Survey of India and the Bodhgaya Temple Committee under the Bodh Gaya Temple Act (1949), ensuring its balanced management of spiritual and historical integrity. It was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage list in 2002 for its "Outstanding Universal Value."</p>

                <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold text-header mb-3">Current Controversies & Management</h3>
                <p class="max-w-3xl mx-auto">While a beacon of Buddhist heritage, Bodhgaya's management is a contested space, reflecting broader religious and political dynamics. Recent protests highlight debates over its governance, offering a crucial contemporary context to its historical significance.</p>

            <div class="px-4">
                <h4 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-header mb-4">Temple Management Debates & Protests</h4>
                <p class="mb-4">The Mahabodhi Temple, central to Bodhgaya's legacy, is managed by the Bodhgaya Temple Management Committee (BTMC), established by the Bodh Gaya Temple Act of 1949. This act mandates a committee with equal representation from Buddhists and Hindus, chaired by Gaya's District Magistrate. Historically, Hindus managed the temple post-13th century, leading to the 1949 act to resolve disputes, with a 2013 amendment allowing a non-Hindu chairperson.</p>
                <p class="mb-6">As of June 2025, Bodhgaya has been at the center of significant controversy regarding the control of the Mahabodhi Temple. Buddhists across India and internationally have protested, demanding full control. These protests, led by the All India Buddhist Forum (AIBF), began in February 2025 and include hunger strikes (some entering their 14th day in February 2025) and rallies, with about 300 monks participating and some extending their hunger strikes into their 14th day. Police have also reportedly taken action, forcibly removing monks in March 2025. Protesters argue this structure marginalizes Buddhist autonomy, given the temple's centrality to their faith. The demands include the repeal of the 1949 act, full Buddhist control, and an end to state interference. Political support has been raised in the Bihar Assembly and Parliament, but as of June 11, 2025, there has been no official government response from Bihar or the central government. Incidents include reports of violence, arrests (e.g., a Bangladeshi monk in May 2025), and social media posts highlighting tensions such as a governor performing Hindu rituals at the temple, viewed as an insult by protestors. Financial issues, like an ₹80 lakh fine on BTMC in 2023 for FCRA violations, also add to the complexity, with transparency concerns noted. A major fire in a local vegetable market in 2025 also affected 115 shops, indicating infrastructural challenges beyond the temple management.</p>

                <p class="text-body text-center max-w-3xl mx-auto mt-6">In conclusion, Bodhgaya remains a beacon of Buddhist heritage, yet its management is a contested space, reflecting broader religious and political dynamics. Travelers should be aware of ongoing protests, ensuring respectful engagement with the site's spiritual significance. Researchers may find the evolving legal and social landscape a rich field for study, given its historical depth and contemporary relevance.</p>

Modest dress (covering shoulders & legs) and removal of shoes inside temples and monasteries are expected out of respect. Mobile phones are generally not allowed inside the main temple, and limited camera use (fees may apply) is permitted elsewhere—always follow onsite instructions.</p>
                        <p class="text-body">While generally safe, heightened security measures are in place following the 2013 bombings (where multiple bombs exploded in the temple and surrounding areas; thankfully, key shrines and the Bodhi Tree were not harmed, but several people were injured). For health, carry bottled water, use sun protection in summers, and insect repellent in monsoon. Women travelers typically find Bodhgaya welcoming, especially in the well-patrolled temple area.</p>

                controversies: {
                    overview: "Bodhgaya, located in the Gaya district of Bihar, India, is a pivotal religious and cultural site in Buddhism, renowned for its association with the enlightenment of Gautama Buddha. This section provides a detailed examination of its significance, travel logistics, and current controversies, ensuring a thorough understanding for researchers, travelers, and scholars.",
                    managementDetails: "The Mahabodhi Temple Complex is managed by the Bodhgaya Temple Management Committee (BTMC) under the Bihar state government, as per the Bodh Gaya Temple Act of 1949. The committee, equipped with staff for maintenance and security, meets quarterly to review conservation and pilgrim management. Recent pressures for development have led to considerations for defining buffer zones and extending the property to include related sites, ensuring the conservation of its religious character and landscape. Demographic details from 2018 indicate a population of 48,184, with the city covering 20.2 km² and the regional planning area 83.78 km², located at coordinates 24°41′42″N 84°59′33″E. The 1949 act established the BTMC with equal representation from Buddhists and Hindus, chaired by Gaya's District Magistrate, with a 2013 amendment allowing a non-Hindu chairperson. The management is part of the broader Heritage preservation efforts by ASI and UNESCO.",
                    protestDetails: "As of June 2025, Bodhgaya has been at the center of significant controversy regarding the control of the Mahabodhi Temple. Buddhists across India and internationally have protested, demanding full control. These protests, led by the All India Buddhist Forum (AIBF), began in February 2025 and include hunger strikes (some entering their 14th day in February 2025) and rallies, with about 300 monks participating and some extending their hunger strikes into their 14th day. Police have also reportedly taken action, forcibly removing monks in March 2025. Protesters argue this structure marginalizes Buddhist autonomy, given the temple's centrality to their faith. The demands include the repeal of the 1949 act, full Buddhist control, and an end to state interference. Political support has been raised in the Bihar Assembly and Parliament, but as of June 11, 2025, there has been no official government response from Bihar or the central government. Incidents include reports of violence, arrests (e.g., a Bangladeshi monk in May 2025), and social media posts highlighting tensions such as a governor performing Hindu rituals at the temple, viewed as an insult by protestors. Financial issues, like an ₹80 lakh fine on BTMC in 2023 for FCRA violations, also add to the complexity, with transparency concerns noted. A major fire in a local vegetable market in 2025 also affected 115 shops, indicating infrastructural challenges beyond the temple management.",
